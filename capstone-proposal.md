### Name of Student: Ryan Bass
### Name of Project: URL Monsters

### Project's Purpose of Goal: To build up a database of URLs with details, transformed into a game to motivate users to continue collecting data.

### Minimum features:
- User log-in to track who's capturing collected data.
- A connected database for information to be sent and read from (UPC#, Details, Type of Product, etc)
- A way of comparing or competiting against other users (battle system, user specific page)

### Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Javascript (frontend)
- NodeJS, SQL, ExpressJS OR koaJS (backend)
- jQuery, DustJS OR NunjucksJS 

### Stretch Goals
  - Use Swift (or React Native) to create an app to allow users to scan to UPCs with their phone
  - Allow users to create a "monster" that they can "feed" whenever they scan a unique NPC

### Additional Tools Used
- Swift (for stretch goal), or React Native
- nodemon
- promise-mysql

### Notes for Teacher:
The idea is to motivate users to collect UPCs (and entering their details) by either manually entering them in through a webpage or (stretch goal) building an app that scans it. It would follow a "gigapet" type system, in which you're given a monster that needs to be taken care of using "loot" you collect from unique UPCS.
